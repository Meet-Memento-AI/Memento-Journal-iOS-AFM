Hello App Review Team,

Thank you for your feedback regarding our submission (ID: c96f3d15-5c5c-4acc-9182-b2faf3aacff4).

We have addressed both issues:

1. Privacy - App Tracking Transparency (Guideline 5.1.2):
   We have updated our App Privacy Information in App Store Connect to accurately
   reflect that MeetMemento does NOT track users. The previous privacy labels
   were incorrectly configured. Our app:

   • Does NOT share user data with third parties for advertising
   • Does NOT link data with third-party data for tracking purposes
   • Does NOT use any third-party analytics or tracking SDKs
   • Collects email, name, and journal content solely for authentication and
     app functionality

   All "Used for Tracking" labels have been removed from our privacy information.

2. Support URL (Guideline 1.5):
   We have created a comprehensive support page with functional contact information
   and updated the Support URL to:
   https://sebmendo1.github.io/MeetMemento/support.html

   This page includes:
   • Email support contact (hello@withmemento.ai)
   • Comprehensive FAQ section
   • Troubleshooting guides
   • Getting started documentation
   • Links to Privacy Policy and Terms of Service

Both issues have been resolved. The app is ready for re-review.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

2. ❌ Don't list data you don't collect (like Performance Data if you don't use Crashlytics)
3. ❌ Don't use placeholder support URLs
4. ❌ Don't forget to save changes in App Store Connect
5. ❌ Don't submit app for review again - just update info and reply to rejection
