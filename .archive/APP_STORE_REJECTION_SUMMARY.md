## 🚨 Important Notes

### About the Support Email
The support page uses: `hello@withmemento.ai`

**You need to either**:
1. Set up this email (purchase domain + email hosting), OR
2. Update support.html with your real email address

If using Option 2, edit these lines in support.html:
- Line 79: `<a href="mailto:YOUR_EMAIL">YOUR_EMAIL</a>`
- Line 252: `<a href="mailto:YOUR_EMAIL">YOUR_EMAIL</a>`

Then commit and push again.

### About Privacy Labels
- "Used for Tracking" means cross-app/cross-site tracking for ads
- First-party analytics (counting user actions in YOUR app) is NOT tracking
- You don't need ATT unless linking data with third-party advertisers

### Don't Submit New Build
- You don't need to upload a new build
- Just update metadata in App Store Connect
- Reply to the rejection message
- Apple will re-review the existing build
