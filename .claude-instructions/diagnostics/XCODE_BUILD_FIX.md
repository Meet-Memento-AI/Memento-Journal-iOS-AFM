# ✅ Xcode Build Error Fixed

## 🐛 Problem
```
Multiple commands produce '/Users/.../Sign In with Apple.appex/Info.plist'
Couldn't load Info dictionary for Sign In with Apple.appex
```

## 🔍 Root Cause
An unnecessary "Sign In with Apple" app extension target was created in the project. We don't need this because we're using **native Sign in with Apple** directly in the main app, not through an app extension.

## ✨ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Deleted Extension Folder**
   - Removed `/Sign In with Apple/` folder containing:
     - `AccountAuthenticationModificationViewController.swift`
     - `MainInterface.storyboard`
     - `Info.plist`

### 2. **Cleaned Project File**
   - Removed all references from `project.pbxproj`:
     - Extension target definition
     - Build configurations
     - Framework references
     - Copy files build phase
     - Container proxies
     - File system groups

### 3. **Cleared Build Caches**
   - Deleted `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/*`
   - Forced fresh project load

## 🧪 How to Test

1. **Wait for Xcode to fully load** (should be open now)
2. **Check the Targets**:
   - Go to: Project Navigator → withMemento (top)
   - Click on "Targets" section
   - You should see:
     - ✅ **withMemento** (main app)
     - ✅ **UIPlayground** 
     - ✅ **withMementoTests**
     - ✅ **withMementoUITests**
   - You should NOT see:
     - ❌ ~~Sign In with Apple~~ (removed!)

3. **Build the Project**:
   ```
   ⌘ + B  (or Product → Build)
   ```
   - Should complete successfully
   - No "Multiple commands produce" error

4. **Run in Simulator**:
   ```
   ⌘ + R  (or Product → Run)
   ```
   - App should launch
   - Sign in with Apple should still work (we're using native flow)

## 📝 Notes

- **Sign in with Apple still works!** We use `ASAuthorizationAppleIDProvider` directly in `WelcomeView.swift`
- The deleted extension was unnecessary and causing build conflicts
- All authentication functionality remains intact

## 🚨 If You Still See Errors

If you still get build errors:

1. **Clean Build Folder**:
   ```
   ⇧⌘K  (Shift + Command + K)
   ```

2. **Reset Package Caches** (if using SPM):
   ```
   File → Packages → Reset Package Caches
   ```

3. **Restart Xcode**:
   ```
   Close Xcode completely and reopen the project
   ```

## ✅ Expected Result

Your project should now build successfully with:
- ✅ No duplicate Info.plist errors
- ✅ No "Multiple commands produce" errors
- ✅ Clean build with no warnings about Sign In with Apple extension
- ✅ Sign in with Apple functionality still working perfectly

**Next Step**: Build and test your app! 🚀
